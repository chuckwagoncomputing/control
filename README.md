This software runs on a Raspberry Pi, logging at the same time each day the high and low temps, high and low humidities,
and switching on and off the fans, misters, and curtains when the temp goes above or below the setpoint, which is easily changed by the user. The feedlines go on and off at times also set by the user. Vent fans go on and off a set number of minutes. Sprinklers can also be turned on or off.
